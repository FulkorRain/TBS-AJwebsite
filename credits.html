     This div is split into multiple div sections, each section is a box
     each artist gets their own box which has their name, aj username
     and socials (represented by social buttons) as well as 1 - 3 images 
     depending on the size of the screen (of the device being used to view website)
     it'll show 1 if small aka mobile, 2 if medium aka ipad / small laptops, and if big -->
